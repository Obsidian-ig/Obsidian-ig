## How Do I Get Started With Coding?

It depends on what you are interested in coding. But to help you get started here are some beginner languages I would suggest learning:

Python (Good for AI/Machine Learning, and Algorithms Like A*)

HTML (Used to Make Websites.)

JAVASCRIPT (Meant to be used while making websites as it has all of the logic and control of the website. But can be used for many things.)

C# (Good for making games with unity and godot engine. But also good for lots of other things)

If you want to really learn a specific language I would suggest starting off with a beginners tutorial on youtube or smth for the language you want to learn.
