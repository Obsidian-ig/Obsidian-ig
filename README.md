# About Me

A dumb little single developer who makes websites, games, little scripts, mods, etc..
I recently remade my old website You should check it out! [Obsidians Unblocked Revamped](https://obsidianig.com)
I know several programming languages, but I know c# and html the best. I do know python, java, javascript, lua, html, c/c++ though (not very well for some of them).
